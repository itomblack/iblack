  <h3>The Problem</h3>
  <p>
    How do make a harmonica more portable?
  </p>
  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    Inspired by the Blues bars of london, I had decided to take up the Harmonica. On Christmas morning I unwrapped a beautiful metal instrument, and blew my first note.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sadly, I quickly realised it was far too cumbersome to carry. My pockets were already full of my phone, wallet and keys. I searched for a more portable solution. The <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank">pebble {code}</a> music hack day provided me with the inspiration I needed to create a new musical object I could access anywhere. The digital Blues Harp was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    In one day, I designed, coded and performed on this new instrument, powered by the <a href="https://github.com/rserota/wad" target="_blank">Wad.JS</a> library and a dash of JQuery. Amazingly, the performance won me the hack day!

It was named The Adaptive Delivery Framework (ADF) Portal.
  </p>
  <p>
     A workshops was arranged with the client to map out the key stages for the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Agile Manifesto">Agile</a>, <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank">SAFe</a> and Waterfall frameworks. These were mapped to an interactive SVG, through which content could be explored. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The Developers mapped the SVG to unique Urls using Google's <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Angular JS site">Angular JS</a> library. Once this framework was set up, the design could easily be adjusted and the relevant content pages coded. It is browser compatible down to IE9.
  </p>

  <p>
    The site is tracked using <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Google Analtics site">Google Anayltics</a> and receives an average of 2000 hits per month. The next step is to undertake some user testing sessions to add context to this data.

    How can you tell where your Scottish Whisky comes from?
  </p>
  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    As I say sipping the golden spirit in my glass, my mind wandered to the landscapes of Scotland...land of my forefathers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, I had no clue where this particular drink originated from, so the image in my mind was left incomplete. Nothing but a blurred scene of peaty waters and drizzle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lucky for me, the <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank">pebble {code}</a> data visualisation hack day encouraged me explore a solution. In 8 hours I gathered a data set of Single Malt flavours, the <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> Javas4cript library and mixed it up with a dash of <a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>, an open-source mapping library.

          How do you track Agile adoption levels within a global organisation?

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p>
          As a clients at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> continued it's <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Agile Manifesto">Agile</a> transformation, its managers wanted a way to track team progress at following the Agile methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, their current methods were analysed. Teams rated themselves against pre-defined criteria, which was converted in to a spider diagram. Their existing method of representation made it difficult to interpret data effectively. 
        </p>
        <div class="project-central-wrap">
          <img src="../img/work-projects/metrics/metrics-duo-2.png" alt="Image of client data" class="" />
        </div>
        <p>
          A workshop with the key stakeholders provided an understand the requirements of this system, from the user's perspective. Three main personas were identified.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>The Team Member</li>
          <li>The Agile Coach</li>
          <li>The Agile Manager</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
         The ideal future scenario was mapped out. Teams would engage in retrospectives with their agile coach, guided by an app. This would allow consistent data to be tracked across all teams, with added contextual information. The app would visualise team progress over the year, while managers would be able to view aggregated reports to see how the company was doing as a whole.

Quaterly progress was visualised through <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to D3 JS site">D3 charts</a>. An admin section allowed the client to add, edit and remove teams from the system. It is browser compatible down to IE9.

  <p>
    In 2015 I had two aims. Firstly, I wanted to improve my JavaScript knowledge. Secondly, I wanted to sample the delights of home grow vegetables in my dinner.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I found the existing resources on growing vegetables to be lacklustre, I decided to create this app to help fulfil my needs. I gathered data from various resources, and got to work. As the codebase grew larger, so did my crops. You can watch my presentation on the whole experience below.

  <h3>The problem</h3>
  <p>
     How do you enable staff to track their professional development?
  </p>

  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    A new framework for personal development &amp; remuneration was being rolled out at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a>. It mapped ideal traits - Skills, Behaviours &amp; Responsibilities - against which staff could be rated from zero to three.
  </p>
  <p>
    User research was conducted with those who had been through the initial review process, to understand the areas of friction in the existing process. The main problems highlighted were:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>Difficulty navigating the spreadsheet of traits.</li>
    <li>Lack of clarity in the rating system.</li>
    <li>Difficulty visualsing their current state.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Using these insights, an MVP app was mapped out to address these concerns. A personal desktop app was built using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" alt="Link to React JS site">ReactJS</a>. Accounts were managed through Google authentication, enabling users to rate, record and visualise where they are on their career path.

    A workshop was run by <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a>, to understand the training requirements of the client's employees. The main aim of this training course being to promote the benefits of the new Adaptive Delivery Framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    An empathy mapping exercise around staff personas identified the users' key attributes and expectations. 
  </p>
  <p>
    From this analysis the following criteria were constructed:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>Modular</li>
    <li>Adaptable</li>
    <li>Concise</li>

  <p>
    A four-week build schedule was proposed.Wireframes for a set of training module were produced. Each module would consist of a three-minute animation, some reading and a short quiz. Users could choose to learn through video or text, but had to finish at least one before attempting to pass the quiz.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was built as a static site, before being into the client's <a href="http://scorm.com/scorm-explained/one-minute-scorm-overview/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to SCORM explanation">SCORM</a> system. It is browser compatible down to IE9.

  <p>
    At #ArtHackathon2015, our team of artists and designers created a possible solution, in the form of a light and sound installation, powered by tweets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the <a href="https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher" target="_blank" alt="Twitter post fetched Git repo">Twitter post fetcher</a>, I altered the colours and music of a webpage according to each emotional response of tweets, in real time. This was then visualised on the browser of a Raspberry Pi. Using lazer-cut acryclic mounted on to an LED screen, a glowing, morphing sculpture was created.

    Another day, another <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank">pebble {code}</a> hack day. This time, the theme was gaming. I chose to build a mobile friendly colour matching game, using <a href="https://jquerymobile.com/" target="_blank">JQuery Mobile</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>The Product</h3>
  <p>
    To win, you have to try and convert Hex to HSL in your head, and move the sliders to the right combination. The closer the match, the higher the score.

  <h3>The Problem</h3>
  <p>
    How do you rapidly prototype a science-fiction brand for filming?
  </p>
  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    It was the weekend of the Sci Fi London 2015 24h film competition. We had the beginnings of a story of a dystopian existence in which companies could access the minds of willing people. The company - Attain - needed a brand and an interface for it's users.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the team finalised the scripts I fleshed out a design for the Attain UI that could be used captured on camera that same afternoon.
  </p>
  <h3>The Product</h3>
  <p>
    The application was only built for a specific screen size, and many elements were dropped in as SVG's straight out of the comps, but feel free to take a look. The film was never finalized, but you can enjoy a rough cut below.
