    <h4>The Process</h4>
 <!--    <p>I'm working hard to get this exciting project ready for launch. Thanks for your patience!</p>
    <br><br> -->
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>The Package Holidays function of <a href="https://www.travelsupermarket.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to TravelSupermarket">TravelSupermarket</a> was in need of a shake up. I work on the product team helping deliver their new strategy &amp; improve their design process. We have three months to deliver a measurable change.</p>

    <h5>Starting with Analysis</h5>
    <p>You can't expect to change an organisation without first trying to understand the key players within it. We spent the first week interviewing STLs, Data Scientists, BA's &amp; Designers. This highlighted where our team could add the most value.</p>

    <h5>Understanding the User</h5>
    <p>Before I augmented the TSM design team, I needed a better understanding of their customers. I had a collection of existing reports to analyse, as well as access to the <a href="https://analytics.google.com" target="_blank" alt="Link to Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> account. 
    </p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="tsm documents" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-docs.png"/>
    </div>
    <p>After using up the office supply of post-its, I had begun to piece together a portrait of the people who visit the TSM site. We plan to build on this as we go.</p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="tsm data analysis" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-data-1.png"/>
      <img alt="tsm data analysis" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-map.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>Based on our research &amp; the new strategic direction for the product, we prioritised search results as the first section to be overhauled. We broke it down into manageable chunks that could be developed in an Agile way. First up was the search result card. I started with some competitor analysis, comparing the existing product with a number of rival businesses like <a href="https://www.trivago.co.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Trivago">Trivago</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.kayak.co.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Kayak">Kayak</a>.</p>
    

    <h5>Designing for Price Comparison</h5>
    <p>The existing cards made heavy use imagery, which varied in quality. The mobile experience felt disjointed. I set a few goals for the redesign. Firstly, it must include price comparison information. Secondly, the card information needed a balanced heirarchy. Thirdly, the cross device experience needed to be consistent. Finally, the card height needed reducing.</p>
    
     <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="tsm data analysis" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-old-card.png"/>
    </div>
    
    <h5>A Content-first Approach</h5>
    <p>
      When designing, I typically start writing down the key pieces of information that particular item needs to communicate to its audience. This might be visual cues to attract attention, to specific information like price comparison details. Heirarchy is a key factor at this stage.
    </p>
    
    <h5>From Sketches to Sketch</h5>
    <p>
      I structured this content into a new layout. A three column design worked best, with each providing a deeper layer of engagement. The first provided visual stimuli in the form of photos. The second had key top level information for the user (star ratings, reviews &amp; evidence of getting a good deal). The final column provided detailed information &amp; the booking call-to-action.
    </p>

    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="tsm data analysis" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-card-sketch.png"/>
      <img alt="tsm data analysis" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-card-wire.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Prototpying</h5>
    <p>
      After some critique-based iterations, I began testing the designs in a browser. I whipped out my text editor &amp; started converting <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Sketch App">Sketch</a> files into HTML &amp; Sass. For me, it's the best way to understand how a responsive design transitions across different screen sizes. It also helps bridge the gap between the design &amp; development work processes.
    </p>

    <h5>Data Driven Templating</h5>
    <p>
      A key design consideration was how to handle the variability of information on the card. Manually editing multiple fields was time consuming. On a suggestion from the developers, I incorporated <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Handlebars JS">Handlebars.js</a> into my <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> build for the prototypes. I could now instantly populate my prototypes with a data file. After sufficient testing, it was ready to be built for the live site.
    </p>

    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="tsm data analysis" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-data-card.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Testing</h5>
    <p>
      Good design should be supported by the whole team, including the business stakeholders. That's why it's important to make sure we meet or exceed our KPIs. Each new design will be tested &amp; tracked across a segment of users before launch. 
    </p>

    <h5>Increasing Agility</h5>
    <p>
      As our team moves forward, we are commited to improving communication &amp; collaboration. With some departments separated by over 200 miles of British countryside, feedback loops had been limited. Our team has introduced bi-weekly Design &amp; Tech check-ins. With my experience in <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Git site">Git</a> &amp; a tutorial from a developer, I was able to bring live development updates to the screens of the London office. The foundations of a great working relationship are being set. Meanwhile, I'm sketching out the next stages of the design...

    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
       How do you design a digital platform for historical exploration?
    </p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>A well known UK supermarket brand wanted to digitise their historical assets to allow future generations to explore their past. To secure funding, the stakeholders needed to present concepts to the board. Our team had two weeks to investigate their brief, understand their existing tech set up, explore ideas, &amp; present a concept.</p>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>The project aim was to create a platform accessible to researchers, academia, media representatives &amp; the company's own staff. It aspired to raise the supermarket's profile as a heritage brand. The product would replace 4 existing sites as the go to place for archive content. I had to consider how it would provide an engaging new experience, without losing the finer details of existing archive sites already in use.</p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="existing archive" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/archive/archive-old.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>To get a grasp of the existing landscape for archives, data exploration &amp; historical representation, I started with some competitor research. Many offered richly curated experiencess with a linear exploration. Others opted for a data driven approach of interlinking content through metadata tags, allowing a 'rabbit-hole' exploration that could lead anywhere. I saw opportunities for both within this archive.</p>

    <h5>Object Oriented UX</h5>
    <p>Give the nature of the content, I felt an <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/ooux-a-foundation-for-interaction-design" target="_blank" alt="Link to OOUX site">Object-Oriented UX</a> approach was the best way to consider this experience. With over 20,000 items already digitised, the archive would be a collection of interconnected objects, upon which a number of actions could be performed. I worked in trello to explore organisation of the elements and to allow collaboration with the team.</p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="trello board" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/archive/archive-trello.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Ideation workhop</h5>
    <p>To explore ideas for the experience, the whole team engaged in creative exercises around the topics of storytelling &amp; nostalgia. I led a sub-group in sketching up some of these concepts.</p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="ideation workshop" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/archive/archive-ideation.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>With our short turn-around, I went straight from the whiteboard into high-fidelity designs, working in tandem with another designer. We knocked ideas back &amp; forth, taking a stripped back palette from the brand to allow each object to be the focus of attention. We designed the home page, search results, objects &amp; stories as these would be key to selling the concept during the pitch.</p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="card design" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/archive/archive-cards.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Iteration</h5>
    <p>The presentation was a success &amp; the project has secured funding, albeit with a reduced feature set. It's going to be an exciting job iterating on these initial ideas to build &amp; test a production-ready experience.</p>

    </ul>
    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
       How do you enable staff to track their professional development?
    </p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      A new framework for personal development was being rolled out at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a>. It identified the key skills, behaviours &amp; responsibilities the company looked for in its staff. I was part of a small team, set up to improve the way individuals mapped their progress.
    </p>
    <h5>Discovery</h5>
    <p>
      I began by interviewing those who had been through a trial review process, to understand common areas of friction. This revealed:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Difficulty navigating the spreadsheet of traits.</li>
      <li>Lack of clarity in the rating system.</li>
      <li>Difficulty visualising their current state.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>
      With the insights from our initial team workshop, the team gathered for a workshop to plan the first stage of design &amp; development. We co-odinated with the key stakeholders to bring them on board with our proposal, ensuring the product would be a success from both a user &amp; business perspective.
    </p>
    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge was finding a UI solution to organise the large amounts of data on display. I sketched up some ideas, &amp; found a collapsible grid approach to be the most suitable for the needs of our users. A simple colour schemed differentiated ratings &amp; attributes of cards.
    </p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="pdp cards" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/pdp/pdp-2.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Development</h5>
    <p>
      While I worked up wireframes with the other designers, the developers were building the core map functionality using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" alt="Link to React JS site">ReactJS</a>. With the designs ready, I joined in to build the surrounding components &amp; add some much needed styling. Working side-by-side we were able to get our product out to users in a single 2-week sprint. Daily stand-ups kept the team on track.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Validation</h5>
    <p>
      We undertook usability testing before the launch, &amp; followed this up with user interviews as each team member went through the review process. From the findings, I drew up the user journey, in its current state. This revealved key problem areas in the process, ranging from terminology to the architecture of the data. 
    </p>

    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img src="" alt="pdp user journey" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/pdp/pdp-duo-4.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Iteration</h5>
    <p>
      With these insights we were able to start iterating on our initial design. A basic note-taking feature for each card was the number one priority, followed by a way to highlight key cards.
    </p>
    <p>Work on these are underway, &amp; the plan is to keep a continuous feedback process going to develop the product.</p>

    <p>
       How do you efficiently navigate a complex retail environment?
    </p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <p>
      It was a client hack day at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> and I was helping run it from the design side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen a presentation by the <a href="https://www.wayfindr.net/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to Wayfindr project">Wayfindr</a> team, I was keen to explore the potential of iBeacon technology. Speed is of the essence on a hack day, so I quickly narrowed my area of interest to in-store navigation. Shortly after, the concept of <i>'Bacon Beacon'</i> was born. The goal: to navigate directly to a product in a store.
    </p>
    <p>
      We split the team into two strands. While the developers did the hard work attempting to pinpoint beacon locations, I worked on the user journey and produced wireframes. I finished off by visualising the proposed app experience through animation.

    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
       As a client at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> continued it's <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Agile Manifesto">Agile</a> transformation, they needed a way engage staff with the various project management frameworks available to them. It was named The Adaptive Delivery Framework (ADF) Portal.
    </p>
    <h5>Workshops</h5>
    <p>
       Through a set of workshops, we mapped out the key stages for the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Agile Manifesto">Agile</a>, <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank">SAFe</a> and Waterfall frameworks. While the client gathered content for each stage, we designed an interactive SVG that connected them all together.

      The developers mapped the SVG to unique urls using Google's <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Angular JS site">Angular JS</a> library. Once this framework was set up, the design could easily be tweaked where necessary and the relevant content coded.

      The site is tracked using <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Google Analtics site">Google Anayltics</a> and receives an average of 2000 hits per month. Our next step is to undertake some user testing sessions to add context to this data.

    <h4>The Problem</h4>
    <p>
      How do make a harmonica more portable?
    </p>
    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <p>
      Inspired by the Blues bars of london, I had decided to take up the Harmonica. On Christmas morning I unwrapped a beautiful metal instrument, and blew my first note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly, I quickly realised it was far too cumbersome to carry. My pockets were already full of my phone, wallet and keys. I searched for a more portable solution. The <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank">pebble {code}</a> music hack day provided me with the inspiration I needed to create a new musical object I could access anywhere. The digital Blues Harp was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one day, I designed, coded and performed on this new instrument, powered by the <a href="https://github.com/rserota/wad" target="_blank">Wad.JS</a> library and a dash of JQuery. Amazingly, the performance won me the hack day!

    <h4>The Problem</h4>
    <p>
      How can you tell where your Scottish Whisky comes from?
    </p>
    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <p>
      As I say sipping the golden spirit in my glass, my mind wandered to the landscapes of Scotland...land of my forefathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I had no clue where this particular drink originated from, so the image in my mind was left incomplete. Nothing but a blurred scene of peaty waters and drizzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucky for me, the <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank">pebble {code}</a> data visualisation hack day encouraged me explore a solution. In 8 hours I gathered a data set of Single Malt flavours, the <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> Javas4cript library and mixed it up with a dash of <a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>, an open-source mapping library.

    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
      How do you track Agile adoption levels within a global organisation?
    </p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      As a client at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> continued it's <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Agile Manifesto">Agile</a> transformation, its managers wanted a way to track team progress at following the Agile methodology.
    </p>
    <h5>Analysis</h5>
    <p>
      First, I analysed their current documentation. Their teams rated themselves against pre-defined criteria, which was converted into a chart in either Excel or PowerPoint. Cross-team analysis required reviewing a number of inconsistent presentations. Their existing method of representation made it difficult to interpret data effectively. 
    </p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img src="" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/metrics/metrics-duo-2.png" alt="Image of client data"/>
    </div>
    <p>
      I gathered the key stakeholders for a workshop to flesh out the requirements of this system, from the user's perspective. Three main personas were identified.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>The Team Member</li>
      <li>The Agile Coach</li>
      <li>The Manager</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Defining The MVP</h5>
    <p>
     We mapped out the ideal future state. Teams would engage in retrospectives with their agile coach, using an app to store and analyse data. This would allow consistent data to be tracked across all teams. Teams would be able to visualise their progress over time, while managers would be able to view aggregated reports to see how the company was doing as a whole.
    </p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img src="" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/metrics/metrics-duo-3.png" alt="Image of wireframe process"/>
    </div>
    <h5>Development</h5>
    <p>
      We honed down the feature set to a Minimal Viable Product. I designed a mobile first, interactive assessment tool, which the developers built using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Node JS site">node</a> &amp;  <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" alt="Link to React JS site">ReactJS</a>. I used  <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to D3 JS site">D3 charts</a> to visualise the data. During a second stage of development, I worked on an admin section to let the client add, edit and remove teams from the system. The system was tested for browser compatability down to IE9.

    <h5>Iteration</h5>
    <p>
      The app is being trialled with teams to test its effectiveness. Meanwhile, I have been working on designs for the next set of features, aimed at improving the value of the app to the managers.

      In 2015 I had two goals. Firstly, to improve my JavaScript knowledge. Secondly, to sample the delights of home grown vegetables in my dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I found the existing resources on growing vegetables to be uninspiring, I decided to create this app to help fulfil my needs. I gathered data from various online resources, and got to work. As the codebase grew larger, so did my crops. You can watch my presentation on the whole experience below.

    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
      How can you educate busy staff?
    </p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      When a <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> client wanted a new training course, we knew the first step was to host a workshop. This allowed us to understand the training requirements of the client's employees, instead of designing by assumption.
    </p>
    <h5>Understanding the Problem</h5>
    <p>
      I took the team through an empathy mapping exercise to identify the users' key attributes and expectations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on our findings, we constructed the following criteria for the new platform:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Modular</li>
      <li>Adaptable</li>
      <li>Concise</li>
      <li>Mobile</li>
      <li>Mixed Media</li>
      <li>Personal</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img src="" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/cbt/cbt-duo-2.png" alt="adf app images"/>
    </div>
    <h5>Development</h5>
    <p>
      We proposed a four-week build schedule. I produced wireframes for a set of training modules, and used InVision to create a quick prototype before moving on to the front-end. Each module would consist of a three-minute animation, some written content and a short quiz. Users could choose to learn through video or text, but had to finish at least one before attempting to pass the quiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was built as a static site, before being integrated into the client's <a href="http://scorm.com/scorm-explained/one-minute-scorm-overview/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to SCORM explanation">SCORM</a> system. I tested the browser compatible down to IE9, as per the clients requirements.

    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
      Can you visualise the emotional state of the world?
    </p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <p>
      The intersection between art and technology is a facinating place. At #ArtHackathon2015, our team of artists and designers created 3D light installation that visualised the emotional state of Twitter. We turned real-time data into (what we considered) a beautiful dancing display of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the <a href="https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher" target="_blank" alt="Twitter post fetched Git repo">Twitter post fetcher</a>, I altered the colours and music of a webpage according to each emotional response of tweets. This was then visualised on the browser of a Raspberry Pi. Using lazer-cut acryclic mounted on to an LED screen, a glowing, morphing sculpture was created.
