      How can you educate busy staff?

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      When a <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> client wanted a new training course, we knew the first step was to host a workshop. This allowed us to understand the training requirements of the client's employees, instead of designing by assumption.
    </p>
    <h5>Understanding the Problem</h5>
    <p>
      I took the team through an empathy mapping exercise to identify the users' key attributes and expectations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on our findings, we constructed the following criteria for the new platform:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Modular</li>
      <li>Adaptable</li>
      <li>Concise</li>
      <li>Mobile</li>
      <li>Mixed Media</li>
      <li>Personal</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <h5>Development</h5>
    <p>
      We proposed a four-week build schedule. I produced wireframes for a set of training modules, and used InVision to create a quick prototype before moving on to the front-end. Each module would consist of a three-minute animation, some written content and a short quiz. Users could choose to learn through video or text, but had to finish at least one before attempting to pass the quiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was built as a static site, before being integrated into the client's <a href="http://scorm.com/scorm-explained/one-minute-scorm-overview/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to SCORM explanation">SCORM</a> system. I tested the browser compatible down to IE9, as per the clients requirements.
