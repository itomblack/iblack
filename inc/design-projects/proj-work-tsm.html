    <h4>The Process</h4>
 <!--    <p>I'm working hard to get this exciting project ready for launch. Thanks for your patience!</p>
    <br><br> -->
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>The Package Holidays function of <a href="https://www.travelsupermarket.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to TravelSupermarket">TravelSupermarket</a> was in need of a shake up. I work on the product team helping deliver their new strategy &amp; improve their design process. We have three months to deliver a measurable change.</p>

    <h5>Starting with Analysis</h5>
    <p>You can't expect to change an organisation without first trying to understand the key players within it. We spent the first week interviewing STLs, Data Scientists, BA's &amp; Designers. This highlighted where our team could add the most value.</p>

    <h5>Understanding the User</h5>
    <p>Before I augmented the TSM design team, I needed a better understanding of their customers. I had a collection of existing reports to analyse, as well as access to the <a href="https://analytics.google.com" target="_blank" alt="Link to Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> account. 
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>After using up the office supply of post-its, I had begun to piece together a portrait of the people who visit the TSM site. We plan to build on this as we go.</p>

    </div>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>Based on our research &amp; the new strategic direction for the product, we prioritised search results as the first section to be overhauled. We broke it down into manageable chunks that could be developed in an Agile way. First up was the search result card. I started with some competitor analysis, comparing the existing product with a number of rival businesses like <a href="https://www.trivago.co.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Trivago">Trivago</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.kayak.co.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Kayak">Kayak</a>.</p>
    

    <h5>Designing for Price Comparison</h5>
    <p>The existing cards made heavy use imagery, which varied in quality. The mobile experience felt disjointed. I set a few goals for the redesign. Firstly, it must include price comparison information. Secondly, the card information needed a balanced heirarchy. Thirdly, the cross device experience needed to be consistent. Finally, the card height needed reducing.</p>

    </div>
    
    <h5>A Content-first Approach</h5>
    <p>
      When designing, I typically start writing down the key pieces of information that particular item needs to communicate to its audience. This might be visual cues to attract attention, to specific information like price comparison details. Heirarchy is a key factor at this stage.
    </p>
    
    <h5>From Sketches to Sketch</h5>
    <p>
      I structured this content into a new layout. A three column design worked best, with each providing a deeper layer of engagement. The first provided visual stimuli in the form of photos. The second had key top level information for the user (star ratings, reviews &amp; evidence of getting a good deal). The final column provided detailed information &amp; the booking call-to-action.

    </div>

    <h5>Prototpying</h5>
    <p>
      After some critique-based iterations, I began testing the designs in a browser. I whipped out my text editor &amp; started converting <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Sketch App">Sketch</a> files into HTML &amp; Sass. For me, it's the best way to understand how a responsive design transitions across different screen sizes. It also helps bridge the gap between the design &amp; development work processes.
    </p>

    <h5>Data Driven Templating</h5>
    <p>
      A key design consideration was how to handle the variability of information on the card. Manually editing multiple fields was time consuming. On a suggestion from the developers, I incorporated <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Handlebars JS">Handlebars.js</a> into my <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> build for the prototypes. I could now instantly populate my prototypes with a data file. After sufficient testing, it was ready to be built for the live site.

    </div>

    <h5>Testing</h5>
    <p>
      Good design should be supported by the whole team, including the business stakeholders. That's why it's important to make sure we meet or exceed our KPIs. Each new design will be tested &amp; tracked across a segment of users before launch. 
    </p>

    <h5>Increasing Agility</h5>
    <p>
      As our team moves forward, we are commited to improving communication &amp; collaboration. With some departments separated by over 200 miles of British countryside, feedback loops had been limited. Our team has introduced bi-weekly Design &amp; Tech check-ins. With my experience in <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Git site">Git</a> &amp; a tutorial from a developer, I was able to bring live development updates to the screens of the London office. The foundations of a great working relationship are being set. Meanwhile, I'm sketching out the next stages of the design...
