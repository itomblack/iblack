    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
       How do you design a digital platform for historical exploration?
    </p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>The UK's second largest supermarket chain wanted to digitise their historical assets to allow future generations to explore their past. To secure funding, the stakeholders needed to present concepts to the board. Our team had two weeks to investigate their brief, understand their existing tech set up, explore ideas, &amp; present a concept.</p>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>The project aim was to create a platform accessible to researchers, academia, media representatives &amp; the company's own staff. It aspired to raise the supermarket's profile as a heritage brand. The product would replace 4 existing sites as the go to place for archive content. I had to consider how it would provide an engaging new experience, without losing the finer details of existing archive sites already in use.</p>

      <img alt="existing archive" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/archive/archive-old.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>To get a grasp of the existing landscape for archives, data exploration &amp; historical representation, I started with some competitor research. Many offered richly curated experiencess with a linear exploration. Others opted for a data driven approach of interlinking content through metadata tags, allowing a 'rabbit-hole' exploration that could lead anywhere. I saw opportunities for both within this archive.</p>

    <h5>Object Oriented UX</h5>
    <p>Give the nature of the content, I felt an <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/ooux-a-foundation-for-interaction-design" target="_blank" alt="Link to OOUX site">Object-Oriented UX</a> approach was the best way to consider this experience. With over 20,000 items already digitised, the archive would be a collection of interconnected objects, upon which a number of actions could be performed. I worked in trello to explore organisation of the elements and to allow collaboration with the team.</p>

    </div>

    <h5>Ideation workhop</h5>
    <p>To explore ideas for the experience, the whole team engaged in creative exercises around the topics of storytelling &amp; nostalgia. I led a sub-group in sketching up some of these concepts.</p>

    </div>

    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>With our short turn-around, I went straight from the whiteboard into high-fidelity designs, working in tandem with another designer. We knocked ideas back &amp; forth, taking a stripped back palette from the brand to allow each object to be the focus of attention. We designed the home page, search results, objects &amp; stories as these would be key to selling the concept during the pitch.</p>

    </div>

    <h5>Iteration</h5>
    <p>The presentation was a success &amp; the project has secured funding, albeit with a reduced feature set. It's going to be an exciting job iterating on these initial ideas to build &amp; test a production-ready experience.</p>
