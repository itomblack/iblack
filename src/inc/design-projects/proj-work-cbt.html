    How can you educate busy staff?

  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    When a <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> client wanted a new training course, we knew the first step was to host a workshop. This allowed us to understand the training requirements of the client's employees, instead of designing by assumption.
  </p>
  <p>
    I took the team through an empathy mapping exercise to identify the users' key attributes and expectations. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on our findings, we constructed the following criteria for the new platform:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>Modular</li>
    <li>Adaptable</li>
    <li>Concise</li>
    <li>Mobile</li>
    <li>Mixed Media</li>
    <li>Personal</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="project-central-wrap">
    <img src="../img/work-projects/cbt/cbt-duo-2.png" alt="adf app images" class="" />
  </div>
  <p>
    We proposed a four-week build schedule. I produced wireframes for a set of training modules, and used InVision to create a quick prototype before moving on to the front-end. Each module would consist of a three-minute animation, some written content and a short quiz. Users could choose to learn through video or text, but had to finish at least one before attempting to pass the quiz.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was built as a static site, before being integrated into the client's <a href="http://scorm.com/scorm-explained/one-minute-scorm-overview/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to SCORM explanation">SCORM</a> system. I tested the browser compatible down to IE9, as per the clients requirements.
