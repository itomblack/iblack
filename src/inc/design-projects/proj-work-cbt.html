    A workshop was run by <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a>, to understand the training requirements of the client's employees. The main aim of this training course being to promote the benefits of the new Adaptive Delivery Framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    An empathy mapping exercise around staff personas identified the users' key attributes and expectations. 
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <ul class="bullet-list">

  <p>
    A four-week build schedule was proposed.Wireframes for a set of training module were produced. Each module would consist of a three-minute animation, some reading and a short quiz. Users could choose to learn through video or text, but had to finish at least one before attempting to pass the quiz.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was built as a static site, before being into the client's <a href="http://scorm.com/scorm-explained/one-minute-scorm-overview/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to SCORM explanation">SCORM</a> system. It is browser compatible down to IE9.
