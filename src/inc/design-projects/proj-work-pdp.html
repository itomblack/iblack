  <h3>The problem</h3>
  <p>
     How do you enable staff to track their professional development?
  </p>

  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    A new framework for personal development &amp; remuneration was being rolled out at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a>. It mapped ideal traits - Skills, Behaviours &amp; Responsibilities - against which staff could be rated from zero to three.
  </p>
  <p>
    User research was conducted with those who had been through the initial review process, to understand the areas of friction in the existing process. The main problems highlighted were:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>Difficulty navigating the spreadsheet of traits.</li>
    <li>Lack of clarity in the rating system.</li>
    <li>Difficulty visualsing their current state.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Using these insights, an MVP app was mapped out to address these concerns. A personal desktop app was built using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" alt="Link to React JS site">ReactJS</a>. Accounts were managed through Google authentication, enabling users to rate, record and visualise where they are on their career path.

    Usabilty testing was performed before the launch, and a more detailed user testing plan was put together for after the review process. The results of this are currently being collected...
