  <h4>The problem</h4>
  <p>
     How do you enable staff to track their professional development?
  </p>

  <h4>The Process</h4>
  <p>
    A new framework for personal development was being rolled out at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a>. It identified the key skills, behaviours &amp; responsibilities the company looked for in its staff. The team needed a way to map their progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    I began with some user research with those who had been through a trial review process, to understand the areas of friction. This revealed:
  </p>
  <ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>Difficulty navigating the spreadsheet of traits.</li>
    <li>Lack of clarity in the rating system.</li>
    <li>Difficulty visualsing their current state.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These insights helped define the MVP. While I designed the dashboard &amp; map, the developers built the functionality using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" alt="Link to React JS site">ReactJS</a>. Accounts were managed through Google authentication, enabling users to rate, record and visualise their personal development progress.

    We undertook usability testing before the launch, and followed this up with user interviews as each team member went through the review process. From this information, I mapped out the user journey. This revealved key problem areas in the process, from terminology to information hierarchies. With these insights we were able to start iterating on our initial design.
