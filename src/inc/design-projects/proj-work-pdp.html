    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
       How do you enable staff to track their professional development?
    </p>

    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
      A new framework for personal development was being rolled out at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a>. It identified the key skills, behaviours &amp; responsibilities the company looked for in its staff. I was part of a small team, set up to improve the way individuals mapped their progress.
    </p>
    <h5>Discovery</h5>
    <p>
      I began by interviewing those who had been through a trial review process, to understand common areas of friction. This revealed:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Difficulty navigating the spreadsheet of traits.</li>
      <li>Lack of clarity in the rating system.</li>
      <li>Difficulty visualising their current state.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>
      With the insights from our initial team workshop, the team gathered for a workshop to plan the first stage of design &amp; development. We co-odinated with the key stakeholders to bring them on board with our proposal, ensuring the product would be a success from both a user &amp; business perspective.
    </p>
    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge was finding a UI solution to organise the large amounts of data on display. I sketched up some ideas, &amp; found a collapsible grid approach to be the most suitable for the needs of our users. A simple colour schemed differentiated ratings &amp; attributes of cards.

    </div>

    <h5>Development</h5>
    <p>
      While I worked up wireframes with the other designers, the developers were building the core map functionality using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" alt="Link to React JS site">ReactJS</a>. With the designs ready, I joined in to build the surrounding components &amp; add some much needed styling. Working side-by-side we were able to get our product out to users in a single 2-week sprint. Daily st&amp;-ups kept the team on track.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Validation</h5>
    <p>
      We undertook usability testing before the launch, &amp; followed this up with user interviews as each team member went through the review process. From the findings, I drew up the user journey, in its current state. This revealved key problem areas in the process, ranging from terminology to the architecture of the data.

    </div>

    <h5>Iteration</h5>
    <p>
      With these insights we were able to start iterating on our initial design. A basic note-taking feature for each card was the number one priority, followed by a way to highlight key cards.
    </p>
    <p>Work on these are underway, &amp; the plan is to keep a continuous feedback process going to develop the product.</p>
