  <h3>The problem</h3>
  <p>
     How do you efficiently navigate a complex retail environment?
  </p>

  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    It was a client hack day at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> and I was helping run it from the design side.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having seen a presentation by the <a href="https://www.wayfindr.net/" target="_blank"  alt="Link to Wayfindr project">Wayfindr</a> team, I was keen to explore the potential of iBeacon technology. Speed is of the essence on a hack day, so I quickly narrowed my area of interest to in-store navigation. Shortly after, the concept of <i>'Bacon Beacon'</i> was born. The goal: to navigate directly to a product in a store.
  </p>
  <p>
    We split the team into two strands. While the developers did the hard work attempting to pinpoint beacon locations, I worked on the user journey and produced wireframes. I finished off by visualising the proposed app experience through animation.
