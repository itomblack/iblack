  <h3>The Problem</h3>
  <p>
    How do you rapidly prototype a science-fiction brand for filming?
  </p>
  <h3>The Process</h3>
  <p>
    It was the weekend of the Sci Fi London 2015 24h film competition. We had the beginnings of a story of a dystopian existence in which companies could access the minds of willing people. The company - Attain - needed a brand and an interface for it's users.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the team finalised the scripts I fleshed out a design for the Attain UI that could be used captured on camera that same afternoon.
  </p>
  <h3>The Product</h3>
  <p>
    The application was only built for a specific screen size, and many elements were dropped in as SVG's straight out of the comps, but feel free to take a look. The film was never finalized, but you can enjoy a rough cut below.
