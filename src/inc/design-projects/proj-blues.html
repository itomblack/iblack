    <h4>The Problem</h4>
    <p>
      How do make a harmonica more portable?
    </p>
    <h4>The Process</h4>
    <p>
      Inspired by the Blues bars of london, I had decided to take up the Harmonica. On Christmas morning I unwrapped a beautiful metal instrument, and blew my first note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly, I quickly realised it was far too cumbersome to carry. My pockets were already full of my phone, wallet and keys. I searched for a more portable solution. The <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank">pebble {code}</a> music hack day provided me with the inspiration I needed to create a new musical object I could access anywhere. The digital Blues Harp was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one day, I designed, coded and performed on this new instrument, powered by the <a href="https://github.com/rserota/wad" target="_blank">Wad.JS</a> library and a dash of JQuery. Amazingly, the performance won me the hack day!
    </p>
    <h4>The product</h4>
    <p>Why bother looking at some images when you can try it out first hand in the browser:</p>
