        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>
          How do you track Agile adoption levels within a global organisation?
        </p>

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p>
          As a client at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> continued it's <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Agile Manifesto">Agile</a> transformation, its managers wanted a way to track team progress at following the Agile methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I analysed their current documentation. Their teams rated themselves against pre-defined criteria, which was converted into a chart in either Excel or PowerPoint. Cross-team analysis required reviewing a number of inconsistent presentations. Their existing method of representation made it difficult to interpret data effectively. 
        </p>
        <div class="project-central-wrap">
          <img src="../img/work-projects/metrics/metrics-duo-2.png" alt="Image of client data" class="" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I gathered the key stakeholders for a workshop to flesh out the requirements of this system, from the user's perspective. Three main personas were identified.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>The Team Member</li>
          <li>The Agile Coach</li>
          <li>The Manager</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
         We mapped out the ideal future state. Teams would engage in retrospectives with their agile coach, using an app to store and analyse data. This would allow consistent data to be tracked across all teams. Teams would be able to visualise their progress over time, while managers would be able to view aggregated reports to see how the company was doing as a whole.

          <img src="../img/work-projects/metrics/metrics-duo-3.png" alt="Image of wireframe process" class="" />
        </div>
        <p>
          We honed down the feature set to a Minimal Viable Product. I designed a mobile first, interactive assessment tool, which the developers built using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Node JS site">node</a> &amp;  <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" alt="Link to React JS site">ReactJS</a>. I used  <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to D3 JS site">D3 charts</a> to visualise the data. During a second stage of development, I worked on an admin section to let the client add, edit and remove teams from the system. The system was tested for browser compatability down to IE9.

        </div>

        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>
          The app is being trialled with teams to test its effectiveness. Meanwhile, I have been working on designs for the next set of features, aimed at improving the value of the app to the managers.
