        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>
          How do you track Agile adoption levels within a global organisation?
        </p>

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p>
          As a clients at <a href="http://pebblecode.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to pebble code site">pebble {code}</a> continued it's <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Agile Manifesto">Agile</a> transformation, its managers wanted a way to track team progress at following the Agile methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, their current methods were analysed. Teams rated themselves against pre-defined criteria, which was converted in to a spider diagram. Their existing method of representation made it difficult to interpret data effectively. 
        </p>
        <div class="project-circles-wrap">

        </div>
        <p>
          A workshop with the key stakeholders provided an understand the requirements of this system, from the user's perspective. Three main personas were identified.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>The Team Member</li>
          <li>The Agile Coach</li>
          <li>The Agile Manager</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
         The ideal future scenario was mapped out. Teams would engage in retrospectives with their agile coach, guided by an app. This would allow consistent data to be tracked across all teams, with added contextual information. The app would visualise team progress over the year, while managers would be able to view aggregated reports to see how the company was doing as a whole.

          The feature set was honed down to a Minimal Viable Product. Using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Node JS site">node</a> &amp;  <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" alt="Link to React JS site">ReactJS</a>, a mobile first, interactive assessment tool was built. Quaterly progress was visualised through <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to D3 JS site">D3 charts</a>. An admin section allowed the client to add, edit and remove teams from the system. It is browser compatible down to IE9.
