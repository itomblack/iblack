 <!--    <p>I'm working hard to get this exciting project ready for launch. Thanks for your patience!</p>

    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>The Package Holidays function of <a href="https://www.travelsupermarket.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to TravelSupermarket">TravelSupermarket</a> was in need of a shake up. I work on the product team delivering their new strategy &amp; an improving their design process. We have 3 months to deliver a measurable change.</p>

    <h5>Stakeholder Interviews</h5>
    <p>You can't expect to change an organisation without first trying to understand the key players within it. We spent the first week interviewing STLs, Data Scientists, BA's and Designers. We quickly saw where our team could add the most value.</p>

    <h5>Understanding the User</h5>
    <p>Before I augmented the TSM design team, I needed to get a better understanding of their customers. I had a colleciton of existing reports to analyse, and access to the <a href="https://analytics.google.com" target="_blank" alt="Link to Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> account. 
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>After using up the office supply of post-its, I had begun to piece together a portrait of the people who visit the TSM site. There was still plenty of potential for further insights through qualitative research though.</p>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>Based on our research and the new strategic direction for the product, we prioritised search results as the first section to be given an overhaul. We broke it down into manageable chunks that could be developed in an Agile way. First up was the search result cards. I started with some competitor analysis, comparing the existing product with a number of rival businesses like <a href="https://www.trivago.co.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Trivago">Trivago</a> and <a href="https://www.kayak.co.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Kayak">Kayak</a>.</p>
    

    <h5>Designing for Price Comparison</h5>
    <p>The existing cards made heavy use imagery, which varied in quality. The mobile experience felt disjointed. I set a few goals for the redesign. Firstly, include price comparison information. Secondly, create a balanced heirarchy to the card information. Thirdly, create a consistent experience across devices. Finally, reduce the card height.</p>

      <img alt="tsm data analysis" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-old-card.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>
      When designing a new item, I typically start writing down a list of what that item is trying to convey to its audience - a checkbox of objectives I can compare my visual designs against. For the card, this started at <i>Attract my attention</i>, went through <i>Show me it's a good deal</i> and ended with <i>Book this holiday</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I got to work organising these into a new card layout. A three column design worked best, with each providing a deeper layer of engagement. The first provided visual stimili in the form of photos. The second, key top level information for the user - star ratings, reviews and evidence they were getting the best deal. The final one provided detailed information and the booking call-to-action

    </div>

    <h5>Prototpying</h5>
    <p>
      After some critique based iterations, I knew the designs needed testing in a browser. I whipped out my text editor and started converting sketch files into HTML and SASS. It's the only way to really understand how a responsive design feels across screen sizes. This also helped bridge the gap between the design &amp; deveopment work processes.
    </p>

    <h5>Data Driven Templating</h5>
    <p>
      A key design consideration was dealing with the variability of information on the card. Manually editing multiple fields was time consuming. On a suggestion from the developers, I incorporated <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Handlebars JS">handlebars.js</a> into my <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> build for the prototypes. I could now instantly populate my prototypes with a data file.

    <h5>Increasing Agility</h5>
    <p>
      As we move forward, we are commited to improving communication and collaboration. With the teams separated by over 200 miles of British countryside, feedback loops had been limited. Our team has introduced bi-weekly Design &amp; Tech check-ins. With my experience in <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Git site">Git</a>, and a tutorial from a developer, I was able to bring live development updates to the screens of the London office. The foundations of a great working relationship are being set. Meanwhile, I'm sketching out the next parts of the design...
