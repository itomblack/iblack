 <!--    <p>I'm working hard to get this exciting project ready for launch. Thanks for your patience!</p>
    <br><br> -->
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>The Package Holidays function of <a href="https://www.travelsupermarket.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to TravelSupermarket">TravelSupermarket</a> was in need of a shake up. I am working on the product team responsible for delivering their new strategy &amp; an improved design process. We have 3 months to deliver a measurable change.</p>

    <h5>Stakeholder Interviews</h5>
    <p>You can't expect to change an organisation without first trying to understand the key players within it. We spent the first week interviewing STLs, Data Scientists, BA's and Designers. We quicly saw where our team could add the most benefit.</p>

    <h5>Understanding the User</h5>
    <p>Before I augmented the TSM design team, I needed to get a better understanding of their customers, based on existing data. I had a colleciton of existing reports to analyse, and access to the <a href="https://analytics.google.com" target="_blank" alt="Link to Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> account.

    <p>After using up the office supply of post-its, I pieced together a portrait of the people who visit the TSM site.</p>

    </div>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>Based on our research and the new strategic direction for the product, we prioritised search results as the first section to be given an overhaul. This needed to be broken down into manageable chunks that could be developed in an Agile way. First up was the search result cards. I started with some competitor analysis, comparing the existing product with a numbe of rival businesses like <a href="https://www.trivago.co.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Trivago">Trivago</a> and <a href="https://www.kayak.co.uk/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Kayak">Kayak</a>.</p>

    

    <h5>Designing for Price Comparison</h5>
    <p>The existing cards made heavy use imagery, which was often poor quality. The mobile experience felt disjointed. My aim was to give a consistent experience across devices, reduce card height, &amp; give a heirarchy to the information to enable improve scannability of content.</p>


    <!-- <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>A well known UK supermarket brand wanted to digitise their historical assets to allow future generations to explore their past. To secure funding, the stakeholders needed to present concepts to the board. Our team had two weeks to investigate their brief, understand their existing tech set up, explore ideas, &amp; present a concept.</p>

    <h5>Product Strategy</h5>
    <p>The project aim was to create a platform accessible to researchers, academia, media representatives &amp; the companies own staff. It aspired to raise the supermarket's profile as a heritage brand. The product would replace 4 existing sites as the go to place for tsm content. I had to consider how it would provide an engaging new experience, without losing the finer details of existing tsm sites already in use.</p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="existing tsm" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-old.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>To get a grasp of the existing landscape for tsms, data exploration &amp; historical representation, I started with some competitor research. Many offered richly curated experiencess with a linear exploration. Others opted for a data driven approach of interlinking content through metadata tags, allowing a 'rabbit-hole' exploration that could lead anywhere. I saw opportunities for both within this tsm.</p>

    <h5>Object Oriented UX</h5>
    <p>Give the nature of the content, I felt an <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/ooux-a-foundation-for-interaction-design" target="_blank" alt="Link to OOUX site">Object-Oriented UX</a> approach was the best way to consider this experience. With over 20,000 items already digitised, the tsm would be a collection of interconnected objects, upon which a number of actions could be performed. I worked in trello to explore organisation of the elements within each object.</p>

      <img alt="trello board" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-trello.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Ideation workhop</h5>
    <p>To explore ideas for the experience, the whole team engaged in some creative exercises around the topics of storytelling &amp; nostalgia. I led a sub-group in sketching up some of these concepts.</p>
    <div class="project-central-wrap">
      <img alt="ideation workshop" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-ideation.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>With our short turn-around, I went straight from the whiteboard into high-fidelity designs, working in tandem with another designer. We knocked ideas back &amp; forth, taking a stripped back palette from the brand to allow each object to be the focus of attention. We designed the home page, search results, objects &amp; stories as these would be key to selling the concept during the pitch.</p>

      <img alt="card design" class="non-load" data-src="../img/design/tsm/tsm-cards.png"/>
    </div>

    <h5>Iteration</h5>
    <p>The presentation was a success &amp; the project has secured funding, albeit with a reduced feature set. It's going to be an exciting job iterating on these initial ideas to build &amp; test a production-ready experience.</p>
